### Status ###
Your bi-winning score determines if you are credited in the final book. Get 10 points and you’ll be credited in the final book as a co-creator. Obtain 50 of these, and you’ll receive your own copy of the book!
On the {% now "jS o\f F" %}, you have:
    - Submitted {{ submitted_chapters.count }} chapter{{ submitted_chapters.count|pluralize }};
    - Edited {{ edited_chapters.count }} chapter{{ edited_chapters.count|pluralize }};
    - Commented {{ commented_chapters.count }} time{{ commented_chapters.count|pluralize }} chapter{{ commented_chapters.count|pluralize }};
    - Rated {{ rated_chapters.count }} chapter{{ rated_chapters.count|pluralize }}.
    - Voted {{ given_positive_votes_on_comments.count }} comment{{ given_positive_votes_on_comments.count|pluralize }} up.
    - {{ received_positive_votes_on_comments.count }} positive vote{{ received_positive_votes_on_comments.count|pluralize }} on comment{{ received_positive_votes_on_comments.count|pluralize }}.
    - {{ received_negative_votes_on_comments.count }} negative vote{{ received_negative_votes_on_comments.count|pluralize }} on comment{{ received_negative_votes_on_comments.count|pluralize }}.

### Feedback and ratings on your chapters ###
